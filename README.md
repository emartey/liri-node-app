Hi there, welcome to LIRI! You may be wondering, well what in the world is LIRI?! Ever heard of SIRI? Well LIRI is SIRI's 1st cousin! Instead of using a user's speech to interpret commands LIRI takes language in the form of typed text and performs the inputted command. LIRI's full name is Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. Please call him LIRI for short :)

Disclaimer: If you are not familiar with coding terminology and/or programs, LIRI may not be the bot for you :'(

Instructions:

1. Open your terminal or command program
2. Navigate to the file path where the LIRI app contents are located on your computer
3. Type in one of the following commands
  
  - spotify-this-song + your desired song choice
    > Will search Spotify and pull a list of songs with or close to the song title entered.
    
 - movie-this + your desired movie choice
    > Will search OMDB and pull relevant information regarding movie inputted in search. 

 - concert-this + your desired artist choice
    > Will search Bands in Town and pull a list of concert dates for selected artist if they have any coming up.


LIRI loves attention and is a free spirit so if you don't give him anything to search, he'll do his own thing! So show LIRI some love and get started NOW! Happy searching ;)
